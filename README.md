This project built a decision tree model to predict diabetes using the BRFSS 2015 dataset. After data preprocessing and feature selection, the model was trained and evaluated, initially achieving an accuracy of 0.768. Hyperparameter tuning improved performance, raising accuracy to 0.844 and F1 score to 0.795.
